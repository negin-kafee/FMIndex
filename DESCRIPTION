Description: This package provides functions to compute the FM Index for a DNA sequence.
    The FM Index includes the Burrows-Wheeler Transform, suffix array, occurrence table,
    and C table for efficient sequence analysis. These components allow for fast and
    memory-efficient searches within the DNA sequence, making it suitable for large
    genomic datasets.
